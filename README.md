# Resume

**Built with Python**

This Python project generates a PDF of a resume using the fpdf library. The resume is formatted with sections such as Summary, Projects, Education, Skills, and Experience. This version (v.1) has a very _basic_ layout and the only styling is an imported font.

### Project Overview

- The script resume_builder.py reads data from a JSON file (resume_data.json) and uses the fpdf library to create a formatted PDF resume.

### The resulting PDF includes:

- **Header**: Displays the name and contact information.

- **Summary**: A brief overview of the individual's professional background and skills.

- **Projects**: Details of relevant projects, including descriptions and technologies used.

- **Education**: Educational background and qualifications.

- **Skills**: A list of skills and technologies.

- **Experience**: Professional work experience, including job titles, companies, dates, and descriptions.
